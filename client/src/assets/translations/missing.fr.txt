[FACT.DESCRIPTION-MISSING] description missing!!
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-NOT-CONTINIOUS] The route is broken: the begin- and end-networknodes cannot be connected through ways either in the forward direction or the backward direction or both.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-UNUSED-SEGMENTS] The route contains ways or part of ways that are not used in the connection between the end nodes.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-NODE-MISSING-IN-WAYS] The end node and/or the begin node is not found in any of the ways of this route.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-REDUNDANT-NODES] The ways of this route contain extra nodes other than the start and end nodes.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-WITHOUT-WAYS] The route does not contain any ways (we expect the route to contain at least 1 way).
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-FIXMETODO] Route definition needs work (has tag _"fixmetodo"_).
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-NAME-MISSING] The route relation does not have a _"note"_ tag with the route name.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-TAG-MISSING] Routerelation does not contain the required _route_ tag.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-TAG-INVALID] Invalid value in required tag _"route"_ in route relation. A bicycle route relation needs to have value _"bicycle"_ in its _"route"_ tag. A hiking route relation needs to have one of the following values in its _"route"_ tag: _"foot"_, _"hiking"_, or _"walking"_. Note that _"walking"_ is a value that is frequently found, but not actually documented as a valid value in the OSM wiki pages.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-UNEXPECTED-NODE] The route relation contains 1 or more unexpected nodes
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-UNEXPECTED-RELATION] The route relation contains one or more unexpected relation members. In route relations we expect only members of type _"way"_, or members of type _"node"_ with a tag _"rwn_ref"_ or _"rcn_ref"_.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.NETWORK-EXTRA-MEMBER-NODE] The network relation contains members of type _"node"_ that are unexpected (we expect only network nodes or information maps as members in the network relation).
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.NETWORK-EXTRA-MEMBER-WAY] The network relation contains members of type _"way"_ (expect only route relations or network nodes as members in the node network relation).
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.NETWORK-EXTRA-MEMBER-RELATION] The network relation contains members of type _"relation"_ that are unexpected (expect only valid route relations or network nodes as members in the node network relation).
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.NODE-MEMBER-MISSING] The node is not member of the network relation.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.INTEGRITY-CHECK-FAILED] The actual number of routes does not match the expected number of routes. Routes with tag "state" equal to "connection" or "alternate" are not counted.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ORPHAN-ROUTE] This route does not belong to a network. The route was not added as a member to a valid network relation.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-INCOMPLETE] The route is marked as having an incomplete definition. A route definition is explicitely marked incomplete by adding a tag _"fixme"_ with value _"incomplete"_ in the route relation.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-INCOMPLETE-OK] The route is marked as having an incomplete definition. A route definition is explicitely marked incomplete by adding a tag _"fixme"_ with value _"incomplete"_ in the route relation. But after analysis, the route seems to be ok.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-UNACCESSIBLE] Part of the route does not seem [accessible](/en/docs/en.html#_accessible).
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-INVALID-SORTING-ORDER] The route is valid, but the sorting order of the ways is incorrect.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-NODE-NAME-MISMATCH] The route name in the _note_ tag in the route relation does not match the expected name as derived from the start and end node of the route.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-NOT-FORWARD] There is no path in the forward direction (from start node to end node).
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-NOT-BACKWARD] There is no path in the backward direction (from end node to start node).
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-ANALYSIS-FAILED] The route could not be analyzed (too complex?).
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-OVERLAPPING-WAYS] No detailed route analysis is performed because the route contains overlapping ways.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-SUSPICIOUS-WAYS] Route with funny ways (for example ways with only 1 node).
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-BROKEN] TODO
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-ONE-WAY] The route is tagged as useable in one direction only. This is OK.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ROUTE-NOT-ONE-WAY] The route is tagged as useable in one direction only, but the analysis logic does find ways in both directions.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.NAME-MISSING] The network relation does not contain the mandatory tag with key "name".
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.ADDED] Added to the analysis.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.BECOME-ORPHAN] Has become orphan.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.DELETED] Deleted from the OpenStreetMap database.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.INTEGRITY-CHECK] This network node has a tag that indicates the expected number of routes that arrive/depart in this node.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.LOST-BICYCLE-NODE-TAG] This node is no longer a valid bicylenetwork node because the rcn_ref tag has been removed.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.LOST-HIKING-NODE-TAG] This node is no longer a valid hikingnetwork node because the rwn_ref tag has been removed.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.LOST-HORSE-RIDING-NODE-TAG] This node is no longer a valid horse riding network node because the rhn_ref tag has been removed.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.LOST-MOTORBOAT-NODE-TAG] This node is no longer a valid motorboatnetwork node because the rmn_ref tag has been removed.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.LOST-CANOE-NODE-TAG] This node is no longer a valid canoenetwork node because the rpn_ref tag has been removed.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.LOST-ROUTE-TAGS] This relation is no longer a valid network route because a required tag has been removed.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.LOST-INLINE-SKATE-NODE-TAG] This node is no longer a valid inline skating network node because the rin_ref tag has been removed.
[FACT.DESCRIPTION.WAS-ORPHAN] No longer an orphan.
[NETWORK-INDICATOR.ORANGE.TITLE] Unexpected - Defined in network relation
[NETWORK-INDICATOR.ORANGE.TEXT] This node is included as a member in the network relation. We did not expect this, because all routes to this node have role "connection". This would mean that the node is part of another network. We expect that the node is not included in the network relation, unless it receives the role "connection".
[NETWORK-INDICATOR.GREEN.TITLE] OK - Defined in network relation
[NETWORK-INDICATOR.GREEN.TEXT] This node is included as a member in the network relation. This is what we expect.
[NETWORK-INDICATOR.GRAY.TITLE] OK - Not defined in network relation
[NETWORK-INDICATOR.GRAY.TEXT] This node is not included as a member in the network relation. This is OK. This node must belong to a different network, because all routes to this node within this network have the role "connection" in the network relation.
[NETWORK-INDICATOR.RED.TITLE] NOK - Not defined in network relation
[NETWORK-INDICATOR.RED.TEXT] This node is not included as a member in the network relation. This is not OK. The convention is to include each node in the network relation. An exception is when the node belongs to another network (all routes to this node have role "connection" in the network relation), then the node does not have to be included as member in the network relation. The node can be added the network relation, but should get the role "connection" in that case.
[NETWORK-INDICATOR.LETTER] N
[NODE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.BLUE.TITLE] OK - Connection
[NODE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.BLUE.TEXT] This node is a connection to another network. All routes to this node have the role "connection" in the network relation.
[NODE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.GRAY.TITLE] OK - No connection
[NODE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.GRAY.TEXT] This node is not a connection to another network. The node would have been considered as a connection to another network if all routes to this node within the network had role "connection" in the network relation.
[NODE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.LETTER] C
[INTEGRITY-INDICATOR.GRAY.TITLE] OK - expected route count missing
[INTEGRITY-INDICATOR.GRAY.TEXT] This network node does not have an _""_ tag. This is OK because the use of this tag is optional.
[INTEGRITY-INDICATOR.GREEN.TITLE] OK - expected route count
[INTEGRITY-INDICATOR.GREEN.TEXT] The number of routes found in this network node () does match the expected number of routes () as defined in the _""_ tag on this node. This is what we expect.
[INTEGRITY-INDICATOR.RED.TITLE] NOK - unexpected route count
[INTEGRITY-INDICATOR.RED.TEXT] The number of routes found in this network node () does not match the expected number of routes () as defined in the _""_ tag on this node.
[INTEGRITY-INDICATOR.LETTER] E
[ROLE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.BLUE.TITLE] OK - Connection
[ROLE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.BLUE.TEXT] This node is a connection to another network. This node has role "connection" in the network relation.
[ROLE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.GRAY.TITLE] OK - No connection role
[ROLE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.GRAY.TEXT] This node does not have role "connection" in het network relation.
[ROLE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.LETTER] C
[ROUTE-INDICATOR.GREEN.TITLE] OK - Defined in route relation
[ROUTE-INDICATOR.GREEN.TEXT] This node is included as a member in one or more route relations.
[ROUTE-INDICATOR.GRAY.TITLE] OK - Not defined in route relation
[ROUTE-INDICATOR.GRAY.TEXT] This node is not included as a member in any route relations. This is OK as including the node as member in the route relations is optional.
