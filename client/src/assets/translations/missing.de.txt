[NETWORK-INDICATOR.ORANGE.TITLE] Unexpected - Defined in network relation
[NETWORK-INDICATOR.ORANGE.TEXT] This node is included as a member in the network relation. We did not expect this, because all routes to this node have role "connection". This would mean that the node is part of another network. We expect that the node is not included in the network relation, unless it receives the role "connection".
[NETWORK-INDICATOR.GREEN.TITLE] OK - Defined in network relation
[NETWORK-INDICATOR.GREEN.TEXT] This node is included as a member in the network relation. This is what we expect.
[NETWORK-INDICATOR.GRAY.TITLE] OK - Not defined in network relation
[NETWORK-INDICATOR.GRAY.TEXT] This node is not included as a member in the network relation. This is OK. This node must belong to a different network, because all routes to this node within this network have the role "connection" in the network relation.
[NETWORK-INDICATOR.RED.TITLE] NOK - Not defined in network relation
[NETWORK-INDICATOR.RED.TEXT] This node is not included as a member in the network relation. This is not OK. The convention is to include each node in the network relation. An exception is when the node belongs to another network (all routes to this node have role "connection" in the network relation), then the node does not have to be included as member in the network relation. The node can be added the network relation, but should get the role "connection" in that case.
[NETWORK-INDICATOR.LETTER] N
[NODE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.BLUE.TITLE] OK - Connection
[NODE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.BLUE.TEXT] This node is a connection to another network. All routes to this node have the role "connection" in the network relation.
[NODE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.GRAY.TITLE] OK - No connection
[NODE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.GRAY.TEXT] This node is not a connection to another network. The node would have been considered as a connection to another network if all routes to this node within the network had role "connection" in the network relation.
[NODE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.LETTER] C
[INTEGRITY-INDICATOR.GRAY.TITLE] OK - expected route count missing
[INTEGRITY-INDICATOR.GRAY.TEXT] This network node does not have an _""_ tag. This is OK because the use of this tag is optional.
[INTEGRITY-INDICATOR.GREEN.TITLE] OK - expected route count
[INTEGRITY-INDICATOR.GREEN.TEXT] The number of routes found in this network node () does match the expected number of routes () as defined in the _""_ tag on this node. This is what we expect.
[INTEGRITY-INDICATOR.RED.TITLE] NOK - unexpected route count
[INTEGRITY-INDICATOR.RED.TEXT] The number of routes found in this network node () does not match the expected number of routes () as defined in the _""_ tag on this node.
[INTEGRITY-INDICATOR.LETTER] E
[ROLE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.BLUE.TITLE] OK - Connection
[ROLE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.BLUE.TEXT] This node is a connection to another network. This node has role "connection" in the network relation.
[ROLE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.GRAY.TITLE] OK - No connection role
[ROLE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.GRAY.TEXT] This node does not have role "connection" in het network relation.
[ROLE-CONNECTION-INDICATOR.LETTER] C
[ROUTE-INDICATOR.GREEN.TITLE] OK - Defined in route relation
[ROUTE-INDICATOR.GREEN.TEXT] This node is included as a member in one or more route relations.
[ROUTE-INDICATOR.GRAY.TITLE] OK - Not defined in route relation
[ROUTE-INDICATOR.GRAY.TEXT] This node is not included as a member in any route relations. This is OK as including the node as member in the route relations is optional.
