      Invalid value in required tag _"route"_ in route relation.

      A bicycle route relation needs to have value _"bicycle"_ in its _"route"_ tag.

      A hiking route relation needs to have one of the following values in its _"route"_ tag: _"foot"_,
      _"hiking"_, or _"walking"_. Note that _"walking"_ is a value that is frequently found,
      but not actually documented as a valid value in the OSM wiki pages.
