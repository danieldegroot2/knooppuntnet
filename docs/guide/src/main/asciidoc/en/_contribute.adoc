[#contribute]
== How to contribute?

Here are a number of ways of how to contribute to the project:

- validate routes on the ground

- map additional nodes/routes/networks

- report errors

- application translation

- documentation

- application testing

- application code


For application translation and documentation, it is best to install the application locally.


[#install-application-locally]
=== Install application locally

These are the instructions for installing the client application on your local computer.


==== yarn

We use https://yarnpkg.com[yarn] to manage the software dependencies and to help in installing
and running the client application.

Go to https://yarnpkg.com, click the install button, and follow the
instructions for your operating system.

==== git

We use git as our version control system. Although it is also possible to download
the code as a zip file, it will be easier to immediately use git, especially if the
intention is to contribute to the project afterwards.

Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads[git downloads] and follow the installation instructions.


==== Install and run

Get the source code:

	git clone https://github.com/vmarc/knooppuntnet.git

Install the software and fetch all dependencies:

	cd knooppuntnet/client/
	yarn install

Build and run the client:

	yarn run start

The above command will build and start the English version of the application in development mode.
Use one of the following commands to start the application in another language:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Language|Command

|English
|yarn run start

|Dutch
|yarn run start:nl

|German
|yarn run start:de

|French
|yarn run start:fr
|===


When starting the application in a language other than English, the texts that are not translated yet are surrounded by square brackets.

Example (untranslated home page):

=== Translate application to different language

Your help to translate the application to a language that is not fully translated yet is very welcome.
To avoid duplication of effort, it is probably a good idea to first contact
https://www.openstreetmap.org/message/new/vmarc[vmarc] to make sure that
the translation that you want to do has not started yet by somebody else.


The translations of texts in the application can be found in the _"locale"_ directory:


	knooppuntnet/client/src/locale


On that directory, you will find following files:

|===
|Language|Command

|English
|translations.xlf

|Dutch
|translations.nl.xlf

|German
|translations.de.xlf

|French
|translations.fr.xlf
|===


These files can be edited manually.
You would look for entries with _state="new"_ to find texts that have not been translated yet.
You can see the English version of the text in de _"source"_ field, and supply the translated
value in the _"target"_ field.
After the text is translated the _state="new"_ entry in the _"target"_ tag should be removed.

Instead of manually editing the translations files, you can also use the application to do this:

Go to https://experimental.knooppuntnet.be/en/translations.

When you select a language in the top part of the page and click _"Load from github"_,
the translations will be loaded from the translation file on
https://github.com/vmarc/knooppuntnet/tree/master/client/src/locale[github].
Use this option if you are starting to translate.

When using the bottom button _"Load from file"_, you can load translations from a file
on your local computer. Use this option if you continue translating from a file
that you saved earlier.

The translation page will present you with untranslated texts.
You can enter the translation in the textarea on the right, and hit the control and
enter key simultaniously to go to the next text to translate
(alternatively you can click the _"Save & next"_ button).

All translations you make are in memory and do not get saved to file until you use
the _"Save to file"_ button.

Use the _"filter"_ field to focus the list of translations to a given subject.
For instance enter _"poi."_ in the _"filter"_ field to limit the list to the
points of interest translations.
The text that you use for the filter is checked against the contents of
each of the columns in the translations table (message id, source, target, source file).

Click the checkbox _"Show translated"_ to see all translations.

Click the checkbox _"Show source code usage locations"_ to see extracts of the code
(read from github) of where the translation text is used.

Save the translations file to the locale directory. For example for German, save to:

	knooppuntnet/client/src/locale/translations.de.xlf

To see your translations in action, restart the application in development for given
language, for example:

	yarn run start:de

The translated texts should appear in the application now.
The untranslated texts are still surrounded by square brackets.

Options to get the translation in the actual application:

- send osm message with translations file contents pasted in a message
to https://www.openstreetmap.org/message/new/vmarc[vmarc]
- create pull request (https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962[GitHub Standard Fork & Pull Request Workflow])
- git commit access


=== Update documentation

The documentation is written in https://asciidoctor.org/docs/[asciidoc], maven is used for installing the
required software and building the documentation.

==== Install maven

Follow instructions on http://maven.apache.org/ to download and install maven.


==== Build documentation

To build the documentation, run the following commands:

	cd knooppuntnet/docs
	mvn compile

After running these commands, you can find the html and pdf documentation in following directories:

	knooppuntnet/docs/target/html
	knooppuntnet/docs/target/pdf

The sources for the documentation can be found here:

	knooppuntnet/docs/src/main/asciidoc

After updating the documentation sources, you can rebuild the documentation:

	cd knooppuntnet/docs
	mvn compile
